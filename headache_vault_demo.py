NEUROLOGY CONSULTATION NOTE

Patient: Sarah Mitchell

Date of Service: 01/26/2026

Member ID: HMK882451677

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chronic migraine with inadequate response to current preventive therapy

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Mitchell is a 40-year-old female with a 15-year history of migraine with aura, now meeting criteria for chronic migraine. She reports experiencing 18-22 headache days per month, with at least 12 meeting full migraine criteria (unilateral, pulsating, moderate-severe intensity, associated nausea/photophobia, worsened by routine activity). Visual aura precedes approximately 40% of attacks.

Current acute treatment includes sumatriptan 100mg which provides relief in approximately 60% of attacks when taken early. She uses acute medication approximately 10-12 days per month, putting her at risk for medication overuse headache.

PRIOR PREVENTIVE MEDICATION TRIALS:
1. Topiramate 100mg daily - trialed for 12 weeks (Jan-Apr 2024). Discontinued due to significant cognitive side effects ("word-finding difficulty, feeling foggy") that impaired her work as a financial analyst. Achieved only 25% reduction in headache frequency.

2. Propranolol 80mg BID (160mg total daily) - trialed for 10 weeks (May-Jul 2024). Discontinued due to fatigue and exercise intolerance. BP dropped to 90/58 on multiple readings. Minimal efficacy (<20% reduction).

3. Amitriptyline 75mg at bedtime - trialed for 14 weeks (Aug-Nov 2024). Discontinued due to excessive daytime sedation, weight gain (12 lbs), and dry mouth. Partial response (~30% reduction) but intolerable side effects.

4. Venlafaxine XR 150mg daily - trialed for 8 weeks (Dec 2024-Feb 2025). Discontinued due to significant nausea, insomnia, and increased anxiety. No meaningful reduction in headache frequency.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
- Sumatriptan 100mg PRN (limited to 9 days/month to avoid MOH)
- Magnesium glycinate 400mg daily
- Riboflavin 400mg daily
- Melatonin 3mg at bedtime

ALLERGIES: Sulfa drugs (rash)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
- Vital Signs: BP 118/76, HR 72, BMI 24.2
- General: Well-appearing, no acute distress
- Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Motor strength 5/5 throughout. Sensation intact. DTRs 2+ and symmetric. Gait normal. No papilledema.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Chronic migraine without aura (G43.709) - ≥15 headache days/month for >3 months
2. Migraine with aura (G43.109) - episodic component
3. History of inadequate response/intolerance to multiple oral preventive classes

PLAN:
Given failure of 4 distinct oral preventive medication classes (anticonvulsant, beta-blocker, TCA, SNRI) at therapeutic doses with adequate trial durations, I recommend initiation of CGRP monoclonal antibody therapy.

Recommend: Ajovy (fremanezumab) 225mg subcutaneous monthly OR 675mg quarterly
- Alternative: Aimovig (erenumab) 70mg monthly, may increase to 140mg if needed
- Alternative: Emgality (galcanezumab) 240mg loading dose, then 120mg monthly

Will submit prior authorization to Highmark BCBS. Patient meets step therapy requirements with documented failure of ≥2 oral preventive classes at therapeutic doses for adequate duration.

Follow-up in 12 weeks to assess response. Target: ≥50% reduction in monthly headache days.
